Dynamic programming:

* Problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved indepdently, reusing of the subproblems , eg: if 1...1...1 appears , we can use reuse it instead of finding or doing operations on it again.
* Recursive structure
* Memoization a dynamic of storing values
int a[] = new int[5];

Backtracking:

* Explore all possible solutions or combinations, backtracking can be suitable approach.
* Like DFS explore all solution space.
