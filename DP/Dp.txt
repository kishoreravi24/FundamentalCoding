Dp -> dynamic programming it is like a technique to solve the problem by dynamically solve the sub problems and merge it to get the answer

two types:

1) Memoization - (top - Down)
2) Tabulation - (bottom - up)

Recursion:
1) express all terms in indexes (i,j) for 2d
2) explore all stuffs
3) sum up all ways / max, minimal

Memoization - dp : start from m-1 , n-1 start from (end to start) i.e m-1, n-1 to 0, 0


Memoization - tabulation:
	1) Declare base cases
	2) express all states in for loop
	3) copy the resource and write

If there is previous row and previous column we can space optimize it.
