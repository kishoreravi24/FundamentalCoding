Design a cache

* Table to store key,value
* Table operations:
    SET and GET
    SET: setting the key and value
    GET: getting the value from key

* cache design
  Capacity for the cache
  Create List to track table

  SET(1,1): checking capacity proceed to setting the value & key is already present or not
  List push front(1)

  SET(2,2): checking capacity proceed to setting the value & key is already present or not
  list push front(2)

  GET(1): print 1

  SET(3,3): checks capacity limit reached
  list pop back() -> SET(2,2) remove (2,2)
  erase(2,2)
  SET(3,3): checking capacity proceed to setting the value & key is already present or not
  List push front(3)

  SET(4,4): check capacity limit reached
  list pop back() -> SET(1,1) remove (1,1)
  erase(1,1)
  SET(4,4): checking capacity proceed to setting the value & key is already present or not
  List push front(4)

  GET(1): return -1
  GET(4): print 4
  GET(3): print 3

 IF Key is already present just remove the previous tracker and keep a new track on List .
