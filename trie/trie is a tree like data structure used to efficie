trie is a tree like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve a dynamic set of strings or sequences - it is used for tasks like string manipulation,string dictionary, insertion,search full text, search substring.

time & space complexity:
insertion O(k) and O(n*m)
search O(k) and O(1)

other types of trie

compressed Trie(Paritica tries or Radix tries):
	aim to reduce memory storages by merging common prefixes.
	more efficient
	but still O(K), but in some cases there are fewer nodes to traverse
suffix trie
	okay if not providing of a keywords if providing a single word we need to do suffix trees
	same like time and space complexity
