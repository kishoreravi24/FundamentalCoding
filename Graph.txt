Graph

Traversal:

Bfs - breath first search, used for serach every node at certain depth level and we can get the shortest path in first search itself

Dfs - depth first search, used for search every node at one branch deeply

Tropological sort:
- Directed acyclic graph

shortest path:

- Dijkstra , we need weight works on both directed and undirected no cycle
- Floyd warshall - handle cycles , on both positive and negative edge weights

Minimum spanning tree:
- prims - undirected graph, no cycles
- kruskal - undirected graph, no cycles

strongly connected components - directed only, because of implementing topological sort

detect cycle in directed - use recursion[parent]
detect cycle in undirected - use parent = -1
